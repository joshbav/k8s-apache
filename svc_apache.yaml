# A service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them.
# For Kubernetes-native applications a simple Endpoints API is updated whenever the set of Pods
#   in a Service changes. For non-native applications, Kubernetes offers a virtual-IP-based bridge
#   to Services which redirects to the backend Pods. Is a layer 4 construct.Â·
